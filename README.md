# surname_classification

I have been interested in language modeling for some time, read a lot about the topic but never did anything by myself. In this project I train a simple RNN to classify a surname into one of the following 17 languages: Czech, German, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Russian, French, English, Hungarian, Spanish, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Korean and Polish. The data and idea are taken from [this pytorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html). Now I can totally dive into training transformers.
